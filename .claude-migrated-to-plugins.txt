# .claude/ Directory Migrated to Plugins

The legacy `.claude/` directory structure has been migrated to the official plugin architecture.

## What Happened

All content from `.claude/` has been reorganized into 6 independent plugins:

1. **skill-activation-core** - Hooks and auto-activation system
2. **backend-development** - Backend skills and agents
3. **frontend-development** - Frontend skills and agents
4. **testing-utilities** - Testing skills
5. **skill-developer-toolkit** - Skill development meta-skill
6. **code-quality-suite** - Review/refactor/documentation agents

## Where to Find Things Now

- **Old**: `.claude/skills/` → **New**: `plugins/*/skills/`
- **Old**: `.claude/agents/` → **New**: `plugins/*/agents/`
- **Old**: `.claude/commands/` → **New**: `plugins/code-quality-suite/commands/`
- **Old**: `.claude/hooks/` → **New**: `plugins/skill-activation-core/hooks/`
- **Old**: `.claude/skills/skill-rules.json` → **New**: `plugins/*/skill-rules.json` (split across plugins)
